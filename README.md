## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AI-AFRICA
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy AI-AFRICA is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.
2. Import the project into Vercel.
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and use the `vercel.json` configuration.
4. Set any required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.

### Manual Production Build

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Security

Currently, the system uses a simulated biometric login. Access to the Dashboard is granted after neural link initialization. Non-authorized users (non-CEOs) are redirected to the subscription portal.
